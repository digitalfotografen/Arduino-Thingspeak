/***********************************************************************************
  SimpleConfig is an Arduino library to load/save configurations from textfiles.
  It pareses a text file or memory area for key value pairs.
  Text file can be stored on SDcard or EEPROM memory
  This design goal of this library was to keep RAM memory use low. 
  The penalty is slow loading. The file is read for every requested key and,
  parsing is performed line by line ignoring any line with the wrong key. 
  
  Comments starts with #
  Keys and values are separated by spaces or colons.
  Keys are not case sensitive, all are converted to lower case
  Configuration kan be divided in groups by adding [groupname] lines.
  
  #sample file
  
  [user1]
  user one
  password secret
  name Uno

  [user2]
  user two
  password topSecret
  name Due
