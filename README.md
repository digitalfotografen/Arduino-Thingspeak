Arduino-Thingspeak
==================

Various small logger and automation projects using Arduino with Thingspeak.

This started by the need to monitor our warer pipe and prevent it from freezing. Later I wrote an article in the Swedish magazine Datormagazin number 5 2014 about this project.

I am experimenting with more uses involving triggers, SMS-notifications and external cron scripts tec to build monitoring chains. My main interrest is to solve daily tasks in hour house. Thus, documentation might not bee 100% up to date and complete. But feel free if You can use it for your own projects. Feedback, bug fixes and notices about your uses are welcome.
