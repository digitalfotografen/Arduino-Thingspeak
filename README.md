Arduino-Thingspeak
==================

Various small logger and automation projects using Arduino with Thingspeak.

This started by the need to monitor our warer pipe and prevent it from freezing. Later I wrote an article in the Swedish magazine Datormagazin number 5 2006 about this project.

I am experimenting with more uses involving triggers and external cron scripts to extend what can be performed. My main interrest is to solve daily tasks in hour house. Thus, documentation might not bee 100% up to date and complete. But feel free if You can use it for your own projects. Feedback, bug fixes and notices about your uses are welcome.
